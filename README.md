Tutorial to familiarize with GitHub

Hello! My name is Brady and I am testing out the GitHub experience in this hello-world tutorial
This is a sample program that will showcase some of features of Git and
how to contribute to an open source project!
  
Remember this is not a real program and it is not intended to serve any function other than learning how to use Git!
Thank you for looking!
